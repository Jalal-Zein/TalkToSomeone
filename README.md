# TalkToSomeone!

## What is "TalkToSomeone!"?
This is a mobile app that serves to give random suggestions about who to talk to when someone just needs to talk to someone :p
The random selection happens within a pool of user-provided names that are stored locally.

## What did I learn?
This is the first full mobile app I create, and I chose to write it in Java as I already have experience with this language. It was interesting to see how I can integrate my knowledge into the Android environment!
I also had to learn about local storage and file access in Android (which wasn't very difficult or unique but still).

## What's next for TalkToSomeone?
This project will probably be neglected for a very long time while I work on other projects that will push my knowledge further. I do have ideas for how to improve this application so maybe with time, I can make those changes and hopefully publish!
